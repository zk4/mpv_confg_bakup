### OSC
what is OSC?
The On Screen Controller (short: OSC) is a minimal GUI integrated with mpv to offer basic mouse-controllability. It is intended to make interaction easier for new users and to enable precise and direct seeking.


### stats
This builtin script displays information and statistics for the currently played file. It is enabled by default if mpv was compiled with Lua support. It can be disabled entirely using the --load-stats-overlay=no option.
