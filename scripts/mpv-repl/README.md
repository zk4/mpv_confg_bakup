- Pasting text is slow on Windows
- Non-ASCII keyboard input doesn't work
- The cursor keys move between Unicode code-points, not grapheme clusters

Disclaimer
----------

This script was written with the hope that it would be useful, but the method
of keyboard input is a bit of a hack (mpv wasn't designed to be a GUI toolkit,)
so there are no guarantees that it will be useful or continue to work.
